The Global Superstore Sales dataset contains information on customer transactions across different countries. The project will explore the data to gain insights into the customer distribution, frequency of purchase, and sales by country.

Firstly, we will present the customer distribution across different countries. This will help us understand the market reach of the store and identify any untapped markets.

Secondly, we will analyze the relationship between frequency of purchase and profit. This will help us identify which customers are more valuable to the store, and which areas to focus on for increasing profits.

Thirdly, we will present the yearly total profit for each segment. This will help us understand the profitability of different product segments and identify areas for improvement.

Fourthly, we will analyze sales per country to identify the countries where the store is performing well, and those where it needs to improve.

Finally, we will present the yearly top 5 products to help the store identify which products are popular with customers and which ones need more focus to increase sales.

Through the use of interactive dashboards and visualizations, we will make it easy for stakeholders to quickly identify trends and insights, and make data-driven decisions to improve the store's performance
